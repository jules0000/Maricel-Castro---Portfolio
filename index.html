        <div class="text-description">
          <p>When I was in college, I was hoping to take the <strong>architecture</strong> course, but my <em>Yoyo</em>,
            my adoptive parent asked me to take <strong>Education</strong> instead since there were no teachers in the
            family.</p>

          <p>Now I come to realize, I guess teaching really is my calling. For more than 3 decades, I was able to impart
            the skills, knowledge, experiences, and learnings that I have, not just in the four corners of the
            classroom, but also to a lot of students, children, colleagues, parents, and the community by which they
            were able to bring as they grew older.</p>

          <p>During my tenure in <em>Binitayan Elementary School</em>, there was not much of activities that honed the
            talents and skills of its students. The school doesn't participate much in programs outside its bounds &
            wasn't well-known for talents coming from the school. I understood why because most of the students, even
            with talent, didn't have the means to join or participate in activities. Some students were also part of the
            indigenous community, but it didn't stop me from helping these kids with a lot of potential. By then, I
            started to coach the <em>Drum & Lyre Corps</em>. I also started looking for great dancers and we
            started the <em>Dance Troupe-BES Warriors/Binitayan Dance Troupe/Pepperezzi</em>, <em>PEP Squad</em>, and
            then the <em>Gymnastics Team</em>. Regardless of their background, as long as they can perform well, I took
            a chance on these kids and believed in their capabilities. There was a lot of potential coming from the
            student body. There were a lot of good children who were not just good in academics but also in physical
            activities. There were a lot of times that we were not supported by the school financially & morally, and I
            have to depend on my income to help my students because I believe that these kids could do more. By then, we
            were able to join a lot of competitions. Our <em>Dance Troupe</em> and <em>PEP Squad</em> were always the
            defending champions in competitions like Juicy Inter-School Competition, Cheerdance & Pep Squad Competitions, Pastores Competitions and etcetera.</p>

          <p>In gymnastics, we only started with improvised equipments,. It was a struggle for us to practice since we do not have the
            equipment for training. We improvised a lot & my athletes trained until nighttime especially when
            competitions are coming up. By the year 2016, I was able to bring my student to the Nationals.</p>

          <p>By then, <em>Binitayan Elementary School</em> became well-known for very young & well-trained
            dancers/performers and athletes. Even the older performers, they felt intimidated in competitions seeing our
            kids performing on stage as they well knew that my dancers were very skilled as well & can keep up with
            them. As my student athletes/dancers grew older, doors & opportunities opened for them as they already had
            the skills, confidence to step up.</p>
